# 🧮 Algorithm Library (Python)

A collection of **data structures and algorithms** implemented in Python.  
Designed to be **clean, well-documented, and tested**.

---

## 📂 Structure
- `algorithms/` → Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming
- `data_structures/` → Stack, Queue, Linked List, Trees
- `tests/` → Unit tests for each algorithm & data structure

---

## 🚀 Implemented
### Algorithms
- Sorting: Bubble, Merge, Quick
- Searching: Linear, Binary
- Dynamic Programming: Fibonacci, Knapsack

### Data Structures
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree

## 🛠️ Setup
Clone the repo and run tests:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saqib777/algorithm-library.git
cd algorithm-library
python -m unittest discover tests
```

---

## ✅ Example: Merge Sort
```python
from algorithms.sorting.merge_sort import merge_sort

print(merge_sort([5, 3, 8, 4, 2]))  
# Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
```

---

## 📊 Testing
Run all tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
